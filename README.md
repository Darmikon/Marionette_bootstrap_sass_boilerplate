### Marionette.js + Almond.js + Compass Boilerplate
==================

This is boilerplate for Marionette.js. I left 2 variants of templates: Handlebars (for require.js !text.js plugin) and JST (underscore.js precompiled). To get additional minimization it's important to use only one of them. Futhermore, plugin Backbone.validateAll.js was included (may be removed).
